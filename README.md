# Trend Analysis using Keyword Scraping

## Overview

This repository provides a set of general-purpose scripts to scrape, preprocess, and visualize keyword data from various web sources. The tools are designed to help users collect and analyze trends based on specific keywords or categories of interest from webpages, blogs, or other online content sources. This suite of scripts is flexible, allowing you to adapt it to scrape different websites and visualize trends for various keywords over time.

## Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to facilitate the following tasks:

1. **Keyword Scraping**: Collect data for specific keywords, tags, or phrases from specified websites. The scraper can extract details like counts, frequencies, or other numeric values associated with each keyword.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean, format, and transform the scraped data for analysis and visualization. This step includes converting timestamps, calculating derived metrics, and organizing the data into a structured format.
3. **Trend Visualization**: Create visual representations of trends over time for each keyword or category. The visualizations provide insights into keyword performance, popularity, and variations.

## Scripts Overview

### 1. **Keyword Scraper**

This script is designed to scrape keyword-related data from any website or blog page. This script can be customized to include different websites, keywords, or content attributes as per the requirements of the user. It utilizes libraries like `requests` and `BeautifulSoup` for making HTTP requests and parsing HTML content. 

**Key Features:**
- Can be adapted to scrape different websites or blogs legally.
- Extracts keyword-related numeric values (e.g., keyword counts, mentions, etc.).
- Stores the scraped data in a CSV file for easy analysis.

**How to Use:**
1. Specify the keywords and target website URLs.
2. Run the script to initiate scraping.
3. View the collected data in the output CSV file.

### 2. **Data Preprocessing**

This script loads the scraped data, transforms it into a structured format, and prepares it for visualization or further analysis. It includes steps like converting timestamps to datetime format, extracting time components (e.g., day, hour), and ensuring data integrity.

**Key Features:**
- Reads in scraped data from CSV files.
- Converts and extracts time components from timestamps.
- Creates a clean and structured DataFrame for analysis.

**How to Use:**
1. Load the scraped data into the script.
2. The script outputs a processed DataFrame with structured data.
3. Save or use the DataFrame for visualization and analysis.

### 3. **Trend Visualization**

This script generates time-series trend visualizations for each unique keyword or category present in the dataset. It allows for easy comparison of trends over time, helping to identify peaks, patterns, and other insights.

**Key Features:**
- Supports plotting trends for any numeric metric associated with a keyword.
- Flexible configuration for different datasets, columns, and visualization needs.
- Creates a grid of subplots for multiple keywords or categories.

**How to Use:**
1. Input the preprocessed DataFrame.
2. Configure the column names for keywords, timestamps, and values.
3. Run the script to generate trend visualizations.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following libraries installed in your Python environment:

- `requests`
- `BeautifulSoup4`
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `csv`
- `logging`

You can install these libraries using:

```bash
pip install requests beautifulsoup4 pandas matplotlib seaborn
```

### Customization

- **Scraping Parameters**: Modify the scraping parameters, URLs, and keyword list to adapt it for different websites and data points.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Update the column names and preprocessing steps to fit your dataset structure.
- **Visualization**: Adjust the plotting parameters, titles, and axis labels for your specific analysis needs.

## Best Practices

- Ensure that your scraping process abides by the terms and conditions of the target website.
- Respect robots.txt and other guidelines for ethical web scraping.
- Avoid overloading servers by limiting the frequency of requests.
